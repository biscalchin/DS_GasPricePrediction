# Natural Gas Price Forecasting Model

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to create a natural gas price forecasting model using five distinct regression techniques. Natural gas price, being a continuous variable, will be predicted using supervised regression algorithms. This project will explore and compare the following regression techniques: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Artificial Neural Network Regression. The aim is to provide a comprehensive review of natural gas price forecasting methods and evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

## Methodology

In this project, we will investigate five regression algorithms for predicting future natural gas prices:

1. **Linear Regression**: This model assumes a linear relationship between explanatory variables and natural gas prices and will serve as our baseline.

2. **Polynomial Regression**: Extending linear regression, this model introduces nonlinear terms to capture more complex relationships between variables.

3. **Decision Trees Regression**: This algorithm divides the explanatory variable space into homogeneous regions and assigns each region a constant value of the target variable.

4. **Random Forest Regression**: An evolution of decision trees regression, this model combines multiple decision trees into an ensemble model to provide robustness and resist overfitting.

5. **Artificial Neural Network Regression**: This approach employs deep neural networks to capture complex nonlinear relationships between explanatory variables and the price of natural gas.

During the analysis, historical natural gas price data or other relevant variables will be used. The data will be split into a training set and a test set to evaluate the predictive performance of each algorithm.

## Expected Results

We anticipate that the performance of the various regression methods in predicting natural gas prices will vary. Here are our initial expectations:

- **Polynomial Regression**: Preferred for more complex correlations.
- **Linear Regression**: Beneficial for roughly linear relationships.
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Effective at handling extremely nonlinear relationships.
- **Decision Trees and Random Forest**: Better at capturing oscillations and interactions in the data.

## Preliminary Conclusions

This project represents a valuable step in our journey to study machine learning principles as undergraduate students in the Master of Science in Data Science program. It allows us to apply theoretical insights learned during our courses in a practical setting by studying and comparing five regression models for forecasting natural gas prices. This experience will provide us with a solid foundation for understanding the importance of algorithm selection based on the nature of the data and forecasting targets as we continue to develop our Data Science skills. We are excited about the upcoming academic challenges and learning opportunities.
